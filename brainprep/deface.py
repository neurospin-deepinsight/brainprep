def deface(anat_file, outdir):
    """ Deface MRI head images using the FSL **fsl_deface** command.

    The UK Biobank study uses a customized image processing pipeline based
    on FSL Alfaro-Almagro et al. (2018), which includes a de-facing
    approach also based on FSL tools. It was designed for use with
    T1w images. This de-facing approach was later extracted from the larger
    processing pipeline and released as part of the main FSL package as
    **fsl_deface**.
    Like **mri_deface** and **pydeface**, this method uses linear
    registration (also FLIRT) to locate its own pre-defined mask of face
    voxels on the target image, then sets voxels in the mask to zero. Unlike
    **mri_deface** and **pydeface**, this method also removes the ears.
    Although it is also relatively popular, we did not include **mask_face**
    Milchenko and Marcus (2013) because previous work has already
    demonstrated that it provides inadequate protection
    Abramian and Eklund (2019).

    Parameters
    ----------
    anat_file: str
        input MRI T1w head image to be defaced: need to be named as
        **\*T1w.<ext>**.
    outdir: str
        the output folder.

    Returns
    -------
    defaced_anat_file: str
        the defaced input MRI head image.
    defaced_mask_file: str
        the defacing binary mask.
