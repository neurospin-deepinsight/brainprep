brainprep: tools for brain MRI Deep Learning pre-processing
===========================================================

\:+1: If you are using the code please add a star to the repository :+1:

`brainprep` is a toolbox that provides common Deep Learning brain anatomical,
functional and diffusion MR images pre-processing scripts, as well as Quality
Control (QC) routines.
You can list all available workflows by running the following command in a
command prompt:

.. code::

    brainprep --help

The general idea is to provide containers to execute these workflows in order
to enforce reproducible research.

This work is made available by a `community of people
<https://github.com/neurospin-deepinsight/brainprep/blob/master/AUTHORS.rst>`_,
amoung which the CEA Neurospin BAOBAB laboratory.
